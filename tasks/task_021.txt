# Task ID: 21
# Title: Streamlined Setup Wizard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the setup process with clearer steps, better guidance, and improved error handling for new users.
# Details:
Create an improved setup wizard with a step-by-step guided process:

1. Design a multi-step setup flow with clear progression:
   - Welcome/introduction
   - Environment selection (demo/live)
   - API key configuration
   - Initial data fetch options
   - Setup completion

2. Implement a responsive HTML interface with:
   - Step indicator showing progress
   - Clear instructions at each step
   - Back/Next navigation
   - Visual cues for environment selection
   - Proper validation at each step

3. Add helpful context:
   - Explanations of each environment option
   - Guidance on where to find API keys
   - Clear indication of what will happen at each step

4. Integrate with error handling to provide clear feedback when issues occur

The wizard should save user preferences and configuration to PropertiesService for persistence between sessions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the wizard flow with both valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify navigation between steps works correctly
3. Test environment selection and configuration
4. Verify API key validation works correctly
5. Test error handling and user feedback
6. Verify preferences are correctly saved to PropertiesService
7. Test the complete setup process end-to-end
