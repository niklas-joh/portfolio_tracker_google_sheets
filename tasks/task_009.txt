Implement helper functions to analyze dividend data, calculate metrics, and generate forecasts.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with various dividend datasets
2. Verify calculations for different time periods
3. Test calendar generation with different payment patterns
4. Verify forecast calculations
5. Test with edge cases (no dividends, many dividends)
6. Check chart generation with different data sets
