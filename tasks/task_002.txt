# Task ID: 2
# Title: Data Model & Repository Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create proper data models and repository classes for different entity types.
# Details:
Implement a structured data model approach with:

1. Model classes for each entity type (Pies, PieItems, Transactions, Dividends, etc.)
   - Each model should handle data validation and transformation
   - Include getters for derived properties

2. Repository classes for each model type:
   - fetchAll() method to retrieve all entities
   - getById() method for single entity retrieval
   - saveToSheet() method to persist data to specific sheets
   - getRecent() method for time-based filtering

3. Data transformation methods to convert between API responses and sheet formats

Each repository should use the ApiClient for data fetching and handle the conversion between raw API data and model objects.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each model class to verify proper data transformation
2. Test repositories with mock API responses
3. Verify data persistence by checking sheet output
4. Test edge cases like empty responses or malformed data
5. Verify that repositories correctly handle API client errors
