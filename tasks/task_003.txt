# Task ID: 3
# Title: Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages and comprehensive logging.
# Details:
Create an ErrorHandler class with the following features:

1. Standardized error codes and user-friendly messages
2. Comprehensive error logging to a dedicated sheet
3. Context-aware error handling that provides appropriate guidance
4. Different handling strategies for different error types:
   - Authentication errors
   - Network/timeout errors
   - Rate limiting errors
   - Data processing errors
   - Permission errors

Implement a centralized logging system that records:
- Timestamp
- Error location/context
- Error type and message
- Additional context information

Ensure all user-facing error messages are clear and actionable.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each error type to verify proper handling
2. Verify error logging works correctly
3. Check that user-facing messages are appropriate and helpful
4. Test integration with other components to ensure errors are properly caught and handled
5. Verify that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
