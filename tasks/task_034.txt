# Task ID: 34
# Title: Refactor: 7.2 Create Mock Objects for Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop mock objects (e.g., MockApiClient) to simulate external dependencies during testing. This will allow for isolated unit testing and faster test execution.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Lack of systematic testing
- Difficulty in validating code changes

Recommended Changes:
Create Mock Objects for Testing. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Mock API client for testing.
 */
class MockApiClient {
  constructor(mockResponses) {
    this.mockResponses = mockResponses;
  }
  
  async get(endpoint, params = {}) {
    if (this.mockResponses[endpoint]) {
      return this.mockResponses[endpoint];
    }
    throw new Error(`No mock response for endpoint: ${endpoint}`);
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define mock object design principles [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the core principles and patterns for creating mock objects in the system
### Details:
Create documentation outlining the mock object design principles including: isolation strategies, state vs. behavior verification approaches, deterministic behavior guidelines, error simulation capabilities, and consistency patterns across different mock implementations. Include examples of proper mock object usage and anti-patterns to avoid.

## 2. Implement core service mocks [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Create mock implementations for API client and sheet services
### Details:
Develop mock implementations for the API client and sheet services following the established design principles. Include methods to simulate successful responses, error conditions, and network failures. Implement configuration options to control response timing, payload contents, and error scenarios. Ensure mocks maintain proper interface compatibility with real implementations.

## 3. Create mock data generation utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Develop utilities to generate realistic test data for mock objects
### Details:
Build a set of utilities to generate realistic test data for use with mock objects. Include functions for creating random but valid data structures, deterministic sequences, edge case values, and domain-specific test data. Implement factories for common data types and composable generators for complex object structures. Document usage patterns and integration with mock objects.

## 4. Integrate mocks with test framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3
### Description: Connect mock implementations with the existing test framework
### Details:
Integrate the mock objects and data generation utilities with the test framework. Create helper functions or fixtures to easily inject mocks into test cases. Implement automatic mock reset/cleanup between tests. Add support for recording mock interactions for verification. Document the integration approach and provide examples of complete test cases using the mock system.
