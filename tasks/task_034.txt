# Task ID: 34
# Title: Refactor: 7.2 Create Mock Objects for Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop mock objects (e.g., MockApiClient) to simulate external dependencies during testing. This will allow for isolated unit testing and faster test execution.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Lack of systematic testing
- Difficulty in validating code changes

Recommended Changes:
Create Mock Objects for Testing. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Mock API client for testing.
 */
class MockApiClient {
  constructor(mockResponses) {
    this.mockResponses = mockResponses;
  }
  
  async get(endpoint, params = {}) {
    if (this.mockResponses[endpoint]) {
      return this.mockResponses[endpoint];
    }
    throw new Error(`No mock response for endpoint: ${endpoint}`);
  }
}
```
