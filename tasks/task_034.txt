# Task ID: 34
# Title: Enhance Add-On User Interface Visuals and Interactivity
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Revamp the add-on's user interface to deliver a more visually appealing and interactive experience, focusing on modern design principles and improved user engagement.
# Details:
Conduct a thorough review of the current UI, identifying outdated visual elements, inconsistent styles, and areas with suboptimal user interaction. Redesign key interface components using a modern design system (e.g., Material Design or custom guidelines), ensuring consistency in color schemes, typography, iconography, and spacing. Implement interactive elements such as responsive buttons, tooltips, hover states, and smooth transitions to enhance usability. Collaborate with UX designers to validate design choices and ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) are met. Refactor front-end code for maintainability and performance, and document all UI changes for future reference.

# Test Strategy:
Perform cross-browser and cross-device testing to verify visual consistency and responsiveness. Conduct usability testing sessions with representative users to gather feedback on the new interface and interactions. Validate that all interactive elements function as intended and meet accessibility requirements. Review UI against design specifications and ensure no regressions in core functionality. Collect and address user feedback post-release to confirm improved satisfaction and engagement.
