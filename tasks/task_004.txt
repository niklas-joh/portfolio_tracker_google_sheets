# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive dashboard sheet with key portfolio metrics.
# Details:
Implement a Portfolio Dashboard sheet with the following sections:

1. Portfolio Summary section:
   - Total value, cash balance, invested amount
   - Total return and return percentage
   - Key performance metrics

2. Weighted Total Return (WTR) chart:
   - Calculate WTR based on deposits and withdrawals
   - Display chart showing portfolio value vs. cumulative deposits
   - Include time-series visualization

3. Allocation chart section:
   - Pie chart showing allocation by instrument type
   - Percentage breakdown of portfolio

4. Recent Activity section:
   - List of most recent transactions
   - Summary of recent changes

Ensure all charts and data visualizations are properly formatted and labeled. Use appropriate number formatting for currency values and percentages.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with various portfolio data to ensure correct calculations
2. Verify chart generation works with different data sets
3. Check formatting and layout on different screen sizes
4. Test with edge cases (empty portfolio, very large portfolios)
5. Verify that the dashboard updates correctly when underlying data changes
