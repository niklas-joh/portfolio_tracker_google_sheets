# Details:
New Features:
Scheduled Refreshes
- Add functionality to automatically refresh data on a schedule
- Implement configurable refresh intervals (daily, hourly, etc.)
- Add email notifications for significant portfolio changes

Example implementation for scheduled refreshes:
```javascript
/**
 * Sets up a time-driven trigger to refresh data on a schedule.
 * 
 * @param {string} frequency - The frequency of the refresh ('hourly', 'daily', 'weekly').
 */
function setupScheduledRefresh(frequency) {
  // Delete any existing triggers
  const triggers = ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers();
  for (const trigger of triggers) {
    if (trigger.getHandlerFunction() === 'refreshPortfolioData') {
      ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(trigger);
    }
  }
  
  // Create new trigger based on frequency
  switch (frequency) {
    case 'hourly':
      ScriptApp.newTrigger('refreshPortfolioData')
        .timeBased()
        .everyHours(1)
        .create();
      break;
    case 'daily':
      ScriptApp.newTrigger('refreshPortfolioData')
        .timeBased()
        .everyDays(1)
        .atHour(6) // 6 AM
        .create();
      break;
    case 'weekly':
      ScriptApp.newTrigger('refreshPortfolioData')
        .timeBased()
        .onWeekDay(ScriptApp.WeekDay.MONDAY)
        .atHour(6) // 6 AM
        .create();
      break;
  }
  
  // Save the configuration
  PropertiesService.getUserProperties().setProperty('REFRESH_FREQUENCY', frequency);
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Trigger Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to manage time-based triggers for scheduled refreshes
### Details:
Design and implement a trigger management system that can schedule and execute data refreshes at specified intervals. Include support for one-time and recurring schedules (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). Define the data model for storing trigger configurations and implement the core scheduling logic that will activate refreshes at the appropriate times.

## 2. Develop Refresh Configuration UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Create user interface components for configuring scheduled refreshes
### Details:
Design and implement UI components that allow users to create, edit, and delete scheduled refreshes. Include options for setting refresh frequency, time windows, data sources to refresh, and notification preferences. Ensure the UI is intuitive and provides clear feedback on the configured schedule.

## 3. Implement Automated Refresh Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Build the system that executes data refreshes based on configured schedules
### Details:
Implement the execution engine that runs when a scheduled refresh is triggered. This should handle the actual data refresh process, including connecting to data sources, fetching updated data, and updating the application's data store. Include error handling, retry logic, and performance optimizations to ensure reliable execution.

## 4. Create Notification System for Refresh Status [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.3
### Description: Develop a system to notify users about the status of scheduled refreshes
### Details:
Implement a notification system that alerts users about the status of scheduled refreshes (started, completed, failed). Support multiple notification channels (in-app, email, push notifications) and allow users to configure their notification preferences. Include detailed information about refresh results, including any errors encountered.

## 5. Implement Refresh History Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.3, 40.4
### Description: Create a system to log and display the history of scheduled refreshes
### Details:
Design and implement a logging system that records details about each refresh execution, including start time, end time, duration, status, and any errors. Create a UI to display refresh history with filtering and sorting options. Include metrics and statistics about refresh performance over time to help users optimize their refresh schedules.
