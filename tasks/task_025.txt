# Task ID: 25
# Title: Refactor: 4.2 Implement Repository Pattern for Data Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Repository design pattern for data access and management. Create repository classes (e.g., BaseRepository, PiesRepository) to abstract data source interactions (API, sheets) and manage data models.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Complex data transformation logic
- Inconsistent sheet updating approach

Recommended Changes:
Implement Repository Pattern for Data Access. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Base repository class for data access.
 */
class BaseRepository {
  constructor(sheetName) {
    this.sheetName = sheetName;
    this.sheet = this.getOrCreateSheet();
  }
  
  getOrCreateSheet() {
    // Implementation...
  }
  
  save(models) {
    // Implementation...
  }
}

/**
 * Pies repository for pie data management.
 */
class PiesRepository extends BaseRepository {
  async fetchAll() {
    const apiClient = ApiClient.getInstance();
    const data = await apiClient.get('equity/pies');
    return data.items.map(item => new PieModel(item));
  }
  
  saveAll(pies) {
    const headers = ['ID', 'Name', 'Value', 'Items'];
    const rows = pies.map(pie => pie.toSheetRow());
    super.writeData(headers, rows);
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Base Repository Interface and Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation interface and abstract base class for the repository pattern
### Details:
Define the IRepository interface with core CRUD methods. Implement a BaseRepository abstract class that will handle common functionality across all repositories. Include error handling, logging, and basic operation templates. Define the contract for data access operations that all specific repositories will implement.

## 2. Implement Specific Repository Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create concrete repository implementations for each data type in the application
### Details:
For each entity type (e.g., User, Project, Task), create a dedicated repository class that extends the BaseRepository. Implement type-specific methods and override base methods as needed. Ensure each repository handles the unique requirements of its entity type while maintaining the consistent interface defined by the base repository.

## 3. Implement Data Fetching Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Develop methods for retrieving data from various sources
### Details:
Implement GetById, GetAll, Find, and other query methods in each repository. Create specialized query methods for common access patterns. Handle pagination, filtering, and sorting. Ensure proper error handling and performance optimization for data retrieval operations.

## 4. Implement Data Saving Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Develop methods for creating, updating, and deleting data
### Details:
Implement Create, Update, Delete, and SaveChanges methods in each repository. Ensure data validation before persistence. Implement transaction support for operations that affect multiple entities. Add optimistic concurrency control where appropriate to prevent data conflicts.

## 5. Integrate Caching Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.4
### Description: Add caching support to the repository pattern implementation
### Details:
Design and implement a caching strategy for frequently accessed data. Add cache invalidation logic for data modifications. Implement configurable cache duration and policies. Create a cache manager that can be injected into repositories. Ensure thread-safety for cache operations in a multi-user environment.

## 6. Migrate Existing Data Access Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3, 25.4, 25.5
### Description: Refactor current data access code to use the new repository pattern
### Details:
Identify all existing data access code throughout the application. Systematically replace direct data access with repository calls. Update dependency injection configuration to provide repositories. Write tests to verify the migration was successful. Document any API changes for other developers.
