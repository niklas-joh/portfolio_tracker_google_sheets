# Task ID: 25
# Title: Scheduled Data Refreshes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable automatic data refreshes on a schedule with configuration options and refresh logging.
# Details:
Implement a system for scheduling automatic data refreshes:

1. Create a scheduling interface that allows users to:
   - Select refresh frequency (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Choose which data types to refresh automatically
   - Enable/disable scheduled refreshes

2. Implement trigger management:
   - Create time-based triggers using ScriptApp
   - Remove existing triggers when changing schedule
   - Store trigger configuration in UserProperties

3. Create the refresh execution function:
   - Read configuration from UserProperties
   - Refresh selected data types
   - Handle errors appropriately
   - Log refresh attempts and results

4. Add a refresh log to track:
   - Timestamp of scheduled refreshes
   - Data types refreshed
   - Success/failure status
   - Error details if applicable

The system should handle edge cases like script timeouts and provide a reliable way to keep data updated automatically.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test trigger creation with different frequency settings
2. Verify trigger removal works when changing schedule
3. Test the refresh execution function with various data type selections
4. Verify error handling during scheduled refreshes
5. Test logging of refresh attempts and results
6. Verify configuration is correctly stored and retrieved
