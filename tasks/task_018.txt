# Task ID: 18
# Title: Refactor: 2.1 Implement Singleton Pattern for Service Classes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the Singleton design pattern for service classes like ApiClient to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application. This will help manage shared resources and state.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Lack of consistent design patterns
- Mixed approach to similar problems

Recommended Changes:
Implement Singleton Pattern for Service Classes. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Singleton pattern for ApiClient.
 */
class ApiClient {
  static instance;
  
  static getInstance(config) {
    if (!ApiClient.instance) {
      ApiClient.instance = new ApiClient(config);
    }
    return ApiClient.instance;
  }
  
  // Rest of the class implementation...
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design singleton pattern for core service classes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure for implementing the singleton pattern in core service classes
### Details:
1. Identify all core service classes that need to be singletons
2. Modify each class to have a private constructor
3. Add a private static instance variable to each class
4. Create a public static getInstance() method for each class
5. Document the singleton implementation with appropriate comments

## 2. Implement instance management and initialization logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop the logic for managing singleton instances and handling initialization
### Details:
1. Implement thread-safe instance creation (using double-checked locking or other appropriate method)
2. Add lazy initialization to defer object creation until needed
3. Handle any required initialization parameters for service instances
4. Implement proper resource cleanup if needed (e.g., in case of application shutdown)
5. Add error handling for initialization failures

## 3. Integrate singleton services with existing code [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Update existing code to use the singleton pattern for accessing service instances
### Details:
1. Identify all locations in the codebase that create or use service instances
2. Replace direct instantiation with calls to getInstance()
3. Update any dependency injection configurations if applicable
4. Write unit tests to verify singleton behavior
5. Perform integration testing to ensure services function correctly with the new pattern
