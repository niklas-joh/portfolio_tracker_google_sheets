# Task ID: 7
# Title: Data Refresh Dashboard
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a centralized dashboard for refreshing data with status indicators.
# Details:
Implement a data refresh dashboard with the following features:

1. Status indicators for each data type showing:
   - Last refresh time
   - Refresh status (success/failure)
   - Staleness indicator

2. One-click refresh buttons for individual data types

3. Refresh all button for updating everything at once

4. Progress tracking during refresh operations

5. Refresh history log

Implement helper functions to:
- Get refresh status for each data type
- Determine if data is stale based on last refresh time
- Format last refresh time in a user-friendly way
- Log refresh attempts and results

# Test Strategy:
1. Test refresh functionality for each data type
2. Verify status indicators update correctly
3. Test with simulated API failures to check error handling
4. Verify refresh history logging
5. Test staleness detection with different timeframes
