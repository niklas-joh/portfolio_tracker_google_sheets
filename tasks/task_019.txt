# Description: Create a comprehensive dashboard sheet with key portfolio metrics, charts, and summary information.
# Details:
Implement a Portfolio Dashboard sheet that provides a complete overview of the user's portfolio with the following sections:

1. Portfolio Summary section:
   - Total portfolio value
   - Cash balance
   - Invested amount
   - Total return (absolute and percentage)

2. Weighted Total Return (WTR) chart section:
   - Calculate WTR based on deposits and withdrawals
   - Create line chart showing portfolio value vs. cumulative deposits
   - Display WTR over time

3. Allocation chart section:
   - Pie chart showing portfolio allocation by instrument type
   - Display percentage and value for each category

4. Recent Activity section:
   - List of most recent transactions
   - Include date, type, ticker, description, and amount

Implement helper functions for each section that:
- Fetch required data using repository classes
- Calculate necessary metrics
- Format data appropriately for display
- Create and configure charts

Ensure the dashboard is visually appealing with proper formatting, headers, and layout.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test dashboard creation with sample portfolio data
2. Verify calculations for portfolio metrics are correct
3. Test WTR calculation with various deposit/withdrawal scenarios
4. Verify charts are created with correct data and formatting
5. Test with different portfolio compositions to ensure allocation chart works correctly
6. Verify dashboard updates correctly when refreshing data
