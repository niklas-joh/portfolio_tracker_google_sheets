# Task ID: 19
# Title: Refactor: 2.2 Use Factory Pattern for Sheet Creation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the Factory design pattern for creating different types of Google Sheets. This will centralize sheet creation logic and make it easier to add new sheet types.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Lack of consistent design patterns
- Mixed approach to similar problems

Recommended Changes:
Use Factory Pattern for Sheet Creation. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Factory for creating different types of sheets.
 */
class SheetFactory {
  static createSheet(type, name) {
    switch (type) {
      case 'account':
        return new AccountSheet(name);
      case 'transactions':
        return new TransactionsSheet(name);
      case 'pies':
        return new PiesSheet(name);
      default:
        return new BaseSheet(name);
    }
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Sheet Factory Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the SheetFactory class that will handle the creation of different sheet types
### Details:
Design and implement the SheetFactory class with a createSheet method that accepts parameters to determine which type of sheet to create. Include appropriate interfaces or abstract classes as needed. Document the factory's public API and ensure it follows SOLID principles.

## 2. Implement Sheet Type Class Hierarchy [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create the necessary sheet type classes with a common interface or base class
### Details:
Define a common interface or abstract base class for all sheet types. Implement concrete sheet classes for each type of sheet needed. Ensure each sheet type implements the required methods and properties. Document the relationships between classes in the hierarchy.

## 3. Integrate Factory with Existing Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Refactor existing sheet creation code to use the new factory pattern
### Details:
Identify all locations in the codebase where sheets are currently created. Replace direct instantiation with calls to the SheetFactory. Update any dependent code that might be affected by the new sheet class hierarchy. Ensure backward compatibility where needed.

## 4. Test Factory Pattern Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Create unit and integration tests for the factory pattern functionality
### Details:
Write unit tests for the SheetFactory class and each sheet type. Create integration tests to verify the factory works correctly with the rest of the application. Test edge cases and error handling. Verify that all existing functionality continues to work with the new implementation.
