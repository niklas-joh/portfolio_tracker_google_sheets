# Task ID: 24
# Title: Refactor: 4.1 Create Data Model Classes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop data model classes (e.g., BaseModel, PieModel) to represent data entities fetched from the API. These classes should encapsulate data processing logic and provide methods for converting data to sheet rows.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Complex data transformation logic
- Inconsistent sheet updating approach

Recommended Changes:
Create Data Model Classes. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Base model class for data entities.
 */
class BaseModel {
  constructor(data) {
    this.rawData = data;
    this.processData();
  }
  
  processData() {
    // Default implementation
  }
  
  toSheetRow() {
    // Convert to array for sheet row
  }
}

/**
 * Pie model for investment pies.
 */
class PieModel extends BaseModel {
  processData() {
    this.id = this.rawData.id;
    this.name = this.rawData.name;
    this.value = this.rawData.value;
    this.items = (this.rawData.items || []).map(item => new PieItemModel(item));
  }
  
  toSheetRow() {
    return [
      this.id,
      this.name,
      this.value,
      this.items.map(item => item.name).join(', ')
    ];
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Base Model Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an abstract base model class that defines common properties and methods for all data entities
### Details:
Implement a BaseModel class that includes: common attributes (ID, timestamps, etc.), serialization/deserialization methods, validation logic, and interfaces for data operations. Consider using inheritance patterns and define abstract methods that child classes must implement.

## 2. Implement Specific Model Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create concrete model classes for each data type that inherit from the base model
### Details:
For each entity type from the API (e.g., User, Product, Order), create a specific model class that extends BaseModel. Define entity-specific properties, override necessary methods, and implement type-specific validation rules. Ensure proper typing and documentation for each class.

## 3. Develop Data Processing Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Implement methods for data transformation, filtering, and aggregation in each model class
### Details:
Add methods to handle data processing operations like filtering records, transforming data formats, calculating derived values, and aggregating information. Include utility methods for common operations and ensure consistent error handling across all processing methods.

## 4. Create Sheet Conversion Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Implement methods to convert model data to and from spreadsheet formats
### Details:
Add functionality to transform model instances to row/column format for spreadsheets and vice versa. Include header generation, data type conversion, formula handling, and methods to batch process multiple records. Ensure proper handling of special characters and formatting options.

## 5. Integrate with Existing Data Handling Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Connect the new model classes with existing data fetching and storage mechanisms
### Details:
Refactor existing data handling code to use the new model classes. Update API service classes to return model instances, modify storage utilities to accept models, and ensure UI components can consume the model data. Write tests to verify proper integration and data flow through the system.
