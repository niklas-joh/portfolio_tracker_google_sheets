Implement a comprehensive Dividend Tracker sheet with multiple sections for dividend analysis:

1. Dividend Summary section:
   - Total dividend income (all time, YTD, last 12 months)
   - Monthly average dividends
   - Number of dividend-paying stocks
   - Portfolio dividend yield

2. Monthly Dividend section:

   - Number of payments
   - Average payment
   - Yield per stock
   - Pie chart of top dividend payers

4. Dividend Calendar section:
   - Visual calendar showing payment patterns

   - Color coding for payment months

5. Dividend Forecast section:
   - Projection of expected dividends for next 12 months
   - Based on historical payment patterns
   - Separate confirmed vs. projected payments
   - Monthly forecast chart

Implement helper functions to:
- Analyze dividend history and calculate metrics
- Group dividends by month and stock
- Create dividend calendar data
- Generate dividend forecasts based on historical patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Test dividend calculations with sample dividend history
2. Verify monthly grouping and calculations
3. Test stock-level dividend metrics
4. Verify calendar generation with various dividend patterns
5. Test forecast calculations with different historical data
6. Verify charts and visualizations display correctly
7. Test with edge cases (no dividends, single dividend stock, etc.)
