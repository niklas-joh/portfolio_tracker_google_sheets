# Task ID: 8
# Title: Improved Data Fetch Modal
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the data fetch modal with better progress tracking and feedback.
# Details:
Create an enhanced data fetch modal with:

1. Detailed data type selection with descriptions:
   - Investment Pies
   - Account Information
   - Cash Balance
   - Transactions
   - Order History
   - Dividends

2. Real-time progress tracking for each data type

3. Clear success/failure indicators

4. Detailed error messages when fetches fail

5. Summary of changes after fetch completes

Implement using HTML service with a responsive design. Use a step-based approach with selection first, then progress tracking.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test selection of different data type combinations
2. Verify progress tracking updates in real-time
3. Test with simulated API failures to check error handling
4. Verify UI updates correctly as fetch progresses
5. Test cancellation functionality
