# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Advanced Portfolio Management Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate advanced functionalities including scheduled data refreshes, automated report generation, dividend tracking, and external data integration to enhance portfolio management capabilities.
# Details:
Design and implement a scheduling system that allows users to configure automatic data refresh intervals for portfolio updates. Build a robust report generation engine capable of producing customizable, exportable reports (PDF, Excel) on portfolio performance, holdings, and transactions. Integrate a dividend tracking module that automatically records, categorizes, and visualizes dividend payments, supporting both manual entry and automated import from supported brokerages or data providers. Establish secure, scalable connections to external financial data sources (e.g., APIs for market data, dividends, and corporate actions), ensuring data normalization, error handling, and compliance with third-party requirements. Ensure all new features are accessible via the existing UI/UX paradigms and are extensible for future enhancements. Consider performance, security, and user privacy throughout the implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify scheduled refreshes by configuring various intervals and confirming that data updates occur automatically and reliably, including handling of edge cases such as missed or failed refreshes. Test report generation by producing reports with different parameters and formats, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and correct export functionality. Validate dividend tracking by simulating both manual and automated data entry, checking for correct aggregation, categorization, and visualization. For external data integration, use mock and live data sources to confirm successful data retrieval, normalization, and error handling. Conduct end-to-end user acceptance testing to ensure all features are discoverable, intuitive, and function seamlessly within the application.
