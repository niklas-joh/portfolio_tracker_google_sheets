Implement mobile-friendly UI improvements:

1. Responsive CSS for all HTML templates:
   - Flexible layouts that adapt to screen size
   - Larger touch targets for mobile
   - Simplified UI for small screens

2. Viewport meta tag for proper scaling

3. Mobile-optimized form elements:
   - Larger input fields
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Appropriate font sizes

4. Simplified layouts for small screens:
   - Stack elements vertically
   - Reduce padding/margins
   - Hide non-essential elements

Create a mobile-specific CSS file that will be included in all HTML templates.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test UI rendering on different screen sizes
2. Verify touch interactions work well on mobile
3. Check form usability on small screens
4. Test with different mobile browsers
5. Verify viewport scaling works correctly
