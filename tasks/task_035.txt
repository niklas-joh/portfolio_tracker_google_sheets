# Task ID: 35
# Title: Refactor: 7.3 Set Up Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33, 34
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish integration tests to verify the interaction between different components and external services (like the API). This will ensure the system works correctly as a whole.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Lack of systematic testing
- Difficulty in validating code changes

Recommended Changes:
Set Up Integration Tests. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Integration test for fetching pies.
 */
function testFetchPies() {
  const runner = new TestRunner();
  
  runner.addTest('Should fetch and process pies', async () => {
    // Set up mock API client
    const mockApiClient = new MockApiClient({
      'equity/pies': { items: [{ id: 1, name: 'Test Pie', value: 100 }] }
    });
    
    // Override API client instance
    ApiClient.instance = mockApiClient;
    
    // Execute the function to test
    const result = await fetchPies();
    
    // Assert the results
    if (!result || result.length !== 1 || result[0].name !== 'Test Pie') {
      throw new Error('Unexpected result from fetchPies');
    }
  });
  
  runner.runTests();
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Integration Test Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive design for the integration test framework including test architecture, patterns, and tools selection.
### Details:
Define the overall integration test architecture, select appropriate testing tools and libraries, establish patterns for test organization, determine how to handle test data, and create guidelines for writing integration tests. Document the framework design decisions and rationale.

## 2. Set Up Test Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Configure and establish the test environment needed for running integration tests.
### Details:
Set up test databases, configure test servers, create Docker containers if needed, establish CI/CD pipeline integration, implement environment variable management, and ensure proper isolation between test environments. Document the environment setup process.

## 3. Implement Core Workflow Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2
### Description: Develop integration tests for core business workflows and processes.
### Details:
Identify critical business workflows, create test cases that verify end-to-end functionality, implement tests that cover the main user journeys, establish proper test data setup and teardown, and ensure tests validate the integration points between core components.

## 4. Implement API Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2
### Description: Create tests that verify the correct integration between API endpoints and backend services.
### Details:
Develop tests for API authentication, implement tests for all critical API endpoints, verify proper error handling and status codes, test API rate limiting and performance characteristics, and ensure data consistency across API calls.

## 5. Implement UI Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2
### Description: Develop tests that verify the integration between UI components and backend services.
### Details:
Set up UI testing tools (like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright), implement tests for critical user interfaces, verify proper data display and form submissions, test UI workflows that span multiple pages or components, and ensure proper error handling and user feedback in the UI.
