# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Portfolio Data Visualization & Analytics Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive module that delivers interactive visualizations and analytics to help users better understand and manage their investment portfolios.
# Details:
Design and implement a suite of data visualizations (e.g., performance charts, asset allocation breakdowns, risk/return scatterplots, historical trend lines) and analytics (e.g., risk metrics, diversification analysis, portfolio optimization insights) tailored for portfolio management. Integrate with existing portfolio data sources, ensuring data accuracy and real-time or near-real-time updates where possible. Provide customizable dashboards, allowing users to select and configure the visualizations and analytics most relevant to their needs. Follow best practices for visualization clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness, ensuring usability across devices. Consider leveraging established visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) and, if feasible, provide export options for reports or raw data. Ensure the module is extensible for future analytics features.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all visualizations accurately reflect underlying portfolio data by cross-checking with sample datasets and manual calculations. Test the responsiveness and clarity of each visualization across desktop and mobile devices. Validate that users can customize dashboards and that changes persist as expected. Confirm that analytics (e.g., risk metrics, allocation percentages) are computed correctly and update in real time with data changes. Conduct usability testing to ensure visualizations are intuitive and actionable. Test export functionality for completeness and correctness of exported data or reports.
