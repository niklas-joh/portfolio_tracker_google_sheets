# Task ID: 32
# Title: Refactor: 6.3 Implement Try-Catch Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement consistent try-catch patterns throughout the codebase to ensure errors are caught and handled by the centralized error handler. This will prevent unhandled exceptions and improve application stability.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Inconsistent error handling
- Unclear error recovery strategies

Recommended Changes:
Implement Try-Catch Patterns. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Example of consistent try-catch pattern.
 */
async function safeApiCall(endpoint, params, context) {
  try {
    const apiClient = ApiClient.getInstance();
    return await apiClient.get(endpoint, params);
  } catch (error) {
    return ErrorHandler.handle(error, {
      location: 'apiCall',
      endpoint,
      params,
      ...context
    });
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design standardized try-catch pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a consistent try-catch pattern template that can be used throughout the application
### Details:
Define the structure of try-catch blocks including error classification, logging format, and recovery strategies. Create documentation with examples of the pattern usage in different scenarios. Consider different error types and appropriate handling strategies for each.

## 2. Develop helper functions for safe operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Create utility functions that wrap common operations in try-catch blocks
### Details:
Implement helper functions for common operations like API calls, file operations, and data parsing. Each function should use the standardized try-catch pattern, handle specific error cases, and provide meaningful error messages. Include retry logic where appropriate.

## 3. Implement context gathering for error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Create mechanisms to collect relevant context information when errors occur
### Details:
Develop functions to gather contextual information such as user state, application state, and relevant data at the time of error. Implement a system to attach this context to error objects. Create a structured format for error reporting that includes this context.

## 4. Apply try-catch patterns in key application areas [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1, 32.2, 32.3
### Description: Identify and implement the standardized try-catch pattern in critical parts of the application
### Details:
Identify critical areas of the application that require robust error handling. Implement the standardized try-catch pattern in these areas, using the helper functions and context gathering mechanisms. Focus on user-facing features, data processing functions, and integration points with external systems.
