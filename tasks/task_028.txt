# Description: Add options for customizing the application theme with different color schemes and visual styles.
# Details:
Implement a theme customization system for the application UI:

1. Create multiple theme options:
   - Light theme (default)
   - Dark theme
   - High contrast theme for accessibility

2. Define CSS variables for each theme:
   - Background color
   - Text color
   - Primary color for buttons and highlights
   - Secondary color for backgrounds
   - Accent color for important elements

3. Implement theme application:
   - Generate CSS based on selected theme
   - Apply theme to all HTML templates
   - Store theme preference in UserProperties

4. Create a theme settings modal:
   - Show available themes with descriptions
   - Allow previewing themes
   - Save theme selection

The system should provide a consistent visual experience across all parts of the application while allowing user customization.

# Test Strategy:

2. Verify CSS is correctly generated and applied
3. Test theme settings modal UI
4. Verify theme preference is saved and retrieved correctly
5. Test appearance across different HTML templates
