# Description: Implement a loading state manager to provide clear feedback to the user during data fetching or processing operations. This will improve the user experience by indicating when the application is busy.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Limited feedback mechanisms

Recommended Changes:
Implement a Loading State Manager. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Loading state manager for UI feedback.
 */
class LoadingManager {
  constructor() {
    this.loadingStates = {};
  }
  
  setLoading(id, isLoading) {
    this.loadingStates[id] = isLoading;
    this.updateUi(id);
  }
  
  updateUi(id) {
    // Implementation to update UI based on loading state
  }
}
```
