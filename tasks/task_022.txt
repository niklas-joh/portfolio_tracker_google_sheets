# Description: Create a centralized dashboard for refreshing data with status indicators and refresh history.
# Details:
Implement a Data Refresh Dashboard that provides a central interface for managing data refreshes:

1. Create a modal interface showing:
   - Last refresh time for each data type
   - Status indicators (up-to-date, stale, never refreshed)
   - Buttons to refresh individual data types or all data

2. Implement refresh status tracking:
   - Store last refresh timestamps in UserProperties
   - Calculate staleness based on time since last refresh
   - Format timestamps in a user-friendly way (e.g., "5 minutes ago")

3. Add a refresh log sheet that records:
   - Timestamp of refresh attempts
   - Data types refreshed
   - Success/failure status
   - Error messages if applicable

4. Create helper functions to:
   - Get refresh status for all data types
   - Format timestamps in relative time
   - Determine if data is stale based on configurable thresholds

The dashboard should provide clear visual indicators of data freshness and make it easy to update specific data types as needed.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test refresh status calculation with various timestamps
2. Verify staleness detection works correctly
3. Test refresh logging functionality
4. Verify UI updates correctly after refreshes
5. Test with multiple data types to ensure all are tracked correctly
6. Verify timestamp formatting for different time periods
