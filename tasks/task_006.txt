Create an improved setup wizard with the following features:

1. Multi-step wizard interface:
   - Welcome/introduction step
   - Environment selection (demo/live)
   - API key configuration
   - Sheet setup and configuration

2. Visual step indicator to show progress

3. Clear instructions and guidance at each step

4. Improved error handling with specific guidance for common issues

Implement using HTML service with a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes. Use MaterializeCSS or similar framework for UI components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the wizard flow from start to finish
2. Verify error handling for invalid inputs
3. Test with different environments (demo/live)
4. Check UI rendering on different screen sizes
5. Verify that configuration is properly saved
6. Test the wizard with both new and existing installations
