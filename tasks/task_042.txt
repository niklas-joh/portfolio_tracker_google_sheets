- Optimize UI for mobile use
- Create mobile-friendly views for key information
- Implement responsive design principles

Example approach for mobile compatibility:
```html
<!-- Example of responsive CSS for mobile compatibility -->
<style>
  /* Base styles */
  .setup-container {
    padding: 20px;
  }
  
  /* Responsive styles */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .setup-container {
      padding: 10px;
    }
    
    .environment-cards {
      flex-direction: column;
    }
    
    .environment-card {
      width: 100%;
      margin-bottom: 15px;
    }
    
    .button-container {
      flex-direction: column;
      gap: 10px;
    }
    
    .button-container button {
      width: 100%;
    }
  }
</style>

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Responsive Design Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and implement a responsive design framework that will serve as the foundation for mobile compatibility.
### Details:
Research and select an appropriate responsive framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS). Implement the core responsive grid system. Set up viewport configurations and breakpoints for different device sizes. Create a responsive container structure that will adapt to various screen sizes.

## 2. Adapt UI Components for Mobile [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.1
### Description: Modify existing UI components to be mobile-friendly with appropriate sizing and interaction patterns.
### Details:
Resize buttons, form elements, and interactive components for touch targets. Implement collapsible menus and navigation for smaller screens. Adjust typography and spacing for readability on mobile devices. Replace hover interactions with mobile-appropriate alternatives.

## 3. Optimize Touch Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.2
### Description: Enhance the application with touch-specific interactions and gestures for mobile users.
### Details:
Implement swipe gestures for common actions. Add touch feedback (visual/haptic) for interactive elements. Ensure sufficient spacing between clickable elements to prevent touch errors. Replace drag-and-drop interactions with mobile-friendly alternatives where necessary.

## 4. Conduct Mobile Layout Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.2, 42.3
### Description: Test the application on various mobile devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent layout and functionality.
### Details:
Create a test matrix covering different device types, screen sizes, and orientations. Test navigation flows and user journeys on mobile devices. Verify that all content is accessible on smaller screens. Document and fix any layout issues or breakpoints problems.

## 5. Optimize Performance for Mobile [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.4
### Description: Improve application performance specifically for mobile devices with limited resources and potentially slower connections.
### Details:
Optimize image loading and sizing for mobile screens. Implement lazy loading for content below the fold. Reduce JavaScript payload and execution time for mobile processors. Test and optimize load times on various connection speeds (3G, 4G, etc.). Consider implementing a Progressive Web App approach if appropriate.
