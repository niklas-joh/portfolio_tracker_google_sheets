# Task ID: 16
# Title: API Client Refactoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Centralize API interactions into a robust client that handles errors, retries, and caching consistently.
# Details:
Create a Trading212ApiClient class that will handle all API interactions with the following features:
1. Consistent error handling with retry logic
2. Response caching to minimize API calls
3. Rate limiting management
4. Proper authentication handling
5. URL construction and parameter handling

The client should support different environments (demo/live) and maintain a clean interface for all API operations. Implement methods for handling GET requests initially, with the ability to extend for other HTTP methods later.

Key methods should include:
- Constructor that accepts environment parameter
- get() method with caching options
- Private helper methods for cache management
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error categorization and handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the client with mocked responses for success and error cases
2. Test cache functionality by verifying cached responses are returned when available
3. Verify retry logic works by simulating network failures
4. Test rate limiting by sending multiple requests in succession
5. Verify proper URL construction with various parameter combinations
6. Test environment switching between demo and live
