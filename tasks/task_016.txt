# Task ID: 16
# Title: Refactor: 1.1 Adopt a Consistent Modular Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement a clear folder structure with well-defined responsibilities as outlined in the refactoring plan. This aims to resolve issues of inconsistent code organization, mixed styles, unclear module boundaries, and duplicate functionality.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Inconsistent code organization with mixed styles (classes vs. standalone functions)
- Unclear module boundaries and responsibilities
- Duplicate functionality across files

Recommended Changes:
Adopt a Consistent Modular Architecture by creating a clear folder structure with well-defined responsibilities:
```
/
├── api/                  # API interaction
│   ├── client.js         # Core API client functionality
│   ├── endpoints.js      # API endpoint definitions
│   └── rateLimiter.js    # Rate limiting logic
├── data/                 # Data processing
│   ├── processors/       # Data transformation
│   ├── cache.js          # Caching functionality
│   └── sheetManager.js   # Sheet interactions

│   ├── modals/           # Modal dialogs
│   └── menu.js           # Menu creation
├── utils/                # Utilities
│   ├── logging.js        # Logging functionality
│   ├── error.js          # Error handling

└── main.js               # Entry point
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Create Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the new folder structure for the modular architecture
### Details:
Create the main module directories (api, data, ui, utils) with appropriate subdirectories. Document the purpose of each directory and establish naming conventions. Create placeholder README files in each directory explaining its purpose and usage guidelines.

## 2. Implement API Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop the API module with clear interfaces and documentation
### Details:
Extract all API-related code into the new structure. Create interface definitions, implement service classes, and establish error handling patterns. Document all endpoints and their usage. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code during transition.

## 3. Implement Data Processing Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop the data processing module with models and transformers
### Details:
Extract all data models, transformers, and processing logic into the data module. Implement clear interfaces between data layer and other modules. Create documentation for data flows and model relationships. Establish patterns for data validation and transformation.

## 4. Implement UI Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.3
### Description: Refactor UI components into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns
### Details:
Reorganize UI components into logical groups. Implement component library with consistent patterns. Create clear interfaces between UI and data/API layers. Document component usage and establish style guidelines. Ensure responsive design principles are maintained.

## 5. Implement Utilities Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a shared utilities module for common functionality
### Details:
Extract all utility functions into appropriate categories (string manipulation, date handling, etc.). Implement comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions. Create documentation with examples for each utility. Ensure utilities are pure functions where possible.

## 6. Refactor Application Entry Points [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Update main entry points to use the new modular architecture
### Details:
Refactor main application entry points to import and use the new modular structure. Implement dependency injection patterns if applicable. Update initialization sequence to respect module dependencies. Create comprehensive integration tests to verify correct operation.

## 7. Create and Execute Migration Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.6
### Description: Develop and implement a phased migration plan for existing code
### Details:
Create a detailed migration plan with phases and milestones. Identify high-risk areas requiring special attention. Implement feature flags to enable gradual transition. Develop comprehensive testing strategy for each migration phase. Document legacy code patterns and their modern replacements.
