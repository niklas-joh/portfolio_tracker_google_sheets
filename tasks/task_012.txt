# Task ID: 12
# Title: Interactive Charts & Visualizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add interactive charts and visualizations for better data exploration.
# Details:
Create a dedicated Charts sheet with enhanced visualizations:

1. Portfolio Value Chart:
   - Line chart showing portfolio value over time
   - Clear formatting and labels
   - Appropriate date and value scales

2. Return Comparison Chart:
   - Bar chart comparing returns across different time periods
   - Percentage-based visualization

3. Holdings Comparison Chart:
   - Bar chart showing top holdings by value
   - Clear formatting and sorting

Implement helper functions to:
- Prepare data for each chart type
- Create and configure charts with appropriate options
- Format data for optimal visualization

Note: While true interactivity is limited in Google Sheets, focus on creating comprehensive, well-formatted charts that provide clear insights.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test chart generation with different data sets
2. Verify formatting and layout
3. Check charts render correctly with various portfolio compositions
4. Test with edge cases (empty data, very large data sets)
5. Verify charts update when underlying data changes
