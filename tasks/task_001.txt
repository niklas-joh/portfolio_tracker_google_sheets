# Task ID: 1
# Title: API Client Refactoring
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Centralize API interactions into a robust client that handles errors, retries, and caching consistently.
# Details:
Create a Trading212ApiClient class that will handle all API interactions with the following features:
- Consistent error handling and retry logic
- Request rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Response caching to improve performance
- Proper authentication handling

Implementation should include:
1. Constructor that accepts environment parameter (demo/live)
2. Methods for different API endpoints (get, post, etc.)
3. Cache management using CacheService
4. Exponential backoff for retries
5. Proper URL construction and parameter handling
6. Authentication header management

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the client with mock responses
2. Test cache functionality by verifying cached responses are returned
3. Test retry logic by simulating network failures
4. Test rate limiting by making rapid sequential requests
5. Verify proper URL construction with different parameter combinations
6. Test with both demo and live environments (using appropriate API keys)
