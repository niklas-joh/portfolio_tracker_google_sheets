# Task ID: 41
# Title: Feature: 9.3 Portfolio Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement portfolio analysis tools, including performance metrics calculation, sector allocation analysis, dividend tracking and forecasting, and risk assessment tools. This will provide users with deeper insights into their portfolio's characteristics.
# Details:
New Features:
Portfolio Analysis
- Implement portfolio performance metrics calculation
- Add sector allocation analysis
- Create dividend tracking and forecasting
- Implement risk assessment tools

Example implementation for sector allocation analysis:
```javascript
/**
 * Analyzes sector allocation in the portfolio.
 * 
 * @returns {Object} Sector allocation data.
 */
function analyzeSectorAllocation() {
  const holdings = getPortfolioHoldings();
  const sectors = {};
  
  // Calculate sector totals
  for (const holding of holdings) {
    if (!sectors[holding.sector]) {
      sectors[holding.sector] = 0;
    }
    sectors[holding.sector] += holding.value;
  }
  
  // Calculate percentages
  const totalValue = holdings.reduce((sum, holding) => sum + holding.value, 0);
  const sectorAllocation = Object.entries(sectors).map(([sector, value]) => ({
    sector,
    value,
    percentage: (value / totalValue) * 100
  }));
  
  // Sort by percentage (descending)
  sectorAllocation.sort((a, b) => b.percentage - a.percentage);
  
  return sectorAllocation;
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Performance Metrics Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to calculate key portfolio performance metrics including returns (absolute, relative, annualized), alpha, beta, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio.
### Details:
Create modular functions for each metric calculation. Ensure time-weighted return calculations account for cash flows. Implement rolling period calculations (1M, 3M, YTD, 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, Max). Include proper error handling for missing data points.

## 2. Develop Sector Allocation Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Create tools to analyze and visualize portfolio sector allocation, sector drift over time, and sector performance contribution.
### Details:
Implement sector classification mapping system. Create visualization components for current allocation vs benchmark. Develop historical sector drift tracking. Calculate sector attribution analysis to identify performance drivers. Include over/underweight indicators.

## 3. Build Dividend Tracking and Forecasting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Implement functionality to track historical dividends and forecast future dividend income based on current holdings and historical patterns.
### Details:
Create dividend calendar visualization. Implement dividend reinvestment simulation. Develop yield calculation and tracking over time. Build forecasting models using historical payout patterns and announced dividends. Include tax impact estimation.

## 4. Implement Risk Assessment Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive risk analysis tools including volatility metrics, drawdown analysis, VaR calculations, and stress testing capabilities.
### Details:
Implement standard deviation, downside deviation, and maximum drawdown calculations. Create Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio projections. Develop Value at Risk (VaR) with multiple confidence intervals. Build stress testing framework for historical and hypothetical scenarios.

## 5. Create Benchmark Comparison System [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1, 41.4
### Description: Implement tools to compare portfolio performance against multiple benchmarks with customizable time periods and visualization options.
### Details:
Develop benchmark data integration from multiple sources. Create relative performance charts with customizable time periods. Implement tracking error calculations. Build benchmark-relative risk metrics. Include custom benchmark creation functionality.

## 6. Develop Historical Performance Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1, 41.4, 41.5
### Description: Build tools for detailed historical performance analysis including rolling returns, drawdown periods, and performance attribution.
### Details:
Implement rolling returns visualization for multiple time periods. Create drawdown analysis with recovery time tracking. Develop performance attribution by security, sector, and asset class. Build calendar year and monthly return tables. Include correlation analysis with market factors.

## 7. Integrate Analysis Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1, 41.2, 41.3, 41.4, 41.5, 41.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive dashboard integrating all analysis components with interactive visualizations and customizable reporting options.
### Details:
Design intuitive UI layout with key metrics prominently displayed. Implement interactive charts with drill-down capabilities. Create customizable dashboard views for different user needs. Develop PDF/Excel report generation. Build alert system for key metric thresholds. Ensure responsive design for multiple devices.
