# Task ID: 23
# Title: Improved Data Fetch Modal
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the data fetch modal with better progress tracking, feedback, and options for data selection.
# Details:
Create an enhanced data fetch modal with improved user experience:

1. Design a two-step modal interface:
   - Step 1: Data selection with clear descriptions and icons
   - Step 2: Progress tracking during fetch

2. Implement data selection features:
   - Checkboxes for each data type with descriptive text
   - Icons to visually distinguish data types
   - Select all/none options
   - Remember previous selections

3. Add detailed progress tracking:
   - Real-time updates during fetch process
   - Individual status indicators for each data type
   - Error messages for failed fetches
   - Summary of results when complete

4. Integrate with the API client and error handling:
   - Show appropriate error messages when issues occur
   - Allow retrying failed fetches
   - Update refresh status after successful fetches

The modal should provide a clear, user-friendly interface for selecting and fetching data with appropriate feedback throughout the process.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the modal interface with various data type selections
2. Verify progress tracking updates correctly during fetches
3. Test error handling and display of error messages
4. Verify retry functionality works for failed fetches
5. Test with slow network conditions to ensure progress updates work
6. Verify refresh status is updated after successful fetches
