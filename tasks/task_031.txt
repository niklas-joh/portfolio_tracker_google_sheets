# Task ID: 31
# Title: Comprehensive User Experience Overhaul
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct a holistic review and enhancement of the add-on's user interface and usability, focusing on intuitive navigation, visual clarity, and streamlined workflows.
# Details:
Perform a thorough UX audit of the add-on, identifying pain points and areas for improvement through user feedback, analytics, and heuristic evaluation. Redesign key UI components for clarity and consistency, ensuring alignment with modern usability standards and accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG). Simplify navigation by reducing unnecessary steps and grouping related actions logically. Enhance visual hierarchy with improved spacing, typography, and iconography. Collaborate with stakeholders to validate proposed changes via wireframes or prototypes before implementation. Ensure all enhancements are compatible with both desktop and mobile environments, and coordinate with recent tasks (context-sensitive help, mobile UI, theme customization) to maintain a cohesive experience.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by conducting usability testing sessions with representative users, measuring improvements in task completion rates, error frequency, and user satisfaction compared to baseline metrics. Review the UI for consistency, accessibility compliance, and responsiveness across supported devices. Confirm that all redesigned elements integrate seamlessly with existing features, including help systems and theme options. Gather stakeholder sign-off on final designs and document all changes for future reference.
