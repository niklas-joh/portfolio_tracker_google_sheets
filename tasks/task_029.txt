# Task ID: 29
# Title: Refactor: 5.3 Create Reusable UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop reusable UI components (e.g., progress indicators, buttons) to ensure consistency and simplify UI development. These components should be modular and easy to integrate.
# Details:
Current Issues:
- Complex UI initialization
- Inconsistent UI handling

Recommended Changes:
Create Reusable UI Components. Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Function to create a progress indicator component.
 */
function createProgressIndicator(steps, currentStep) {
  let html = '<div class="step-indicator">';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    html += `<div class="step-dot ${i === currentStep ? 'active' : ''}"></div>`;
  }
  
  html += '</div>';
  return html;
}
```

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Component Design and Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture and design patterns for UI components
### Details:
Create a comprehensive component architecture document that outlines component hierarchy, state management approach, and component interfaces. Include component lifecycle considerations, prop structures, and reusability patterns. Document naming conventions and folder structure for the component library.

## 2. Core UI Component Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop the essential UI components like buttons, indicators, form elements, etc.
### Details:
Implement the core UI components following the established architecture. Create buttons (primary, secondary, icon buttons), form elements (inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns), indicators (loading spinners, progress bars), and other fundamental components. Ensure components are accessible and follow best practices for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## 3. Component Styling and Theming [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Implement consistent styling and theming system for all components
### Details:
Develop a theming system that allows for consistent styling across components. Create a design token system for colors, typography, spacing, and other visual properties. Implement light/dark mode support and ensure components respond appropriately to theme changes. Document the styling approach and provide examples of theme customization.

## 4. Integration with Existing UI Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Integrate the new component library with the existing UI codebase
### Details:
Replace existing UI elements with the new component library systematically. Create migration guides for developers to adopt the new components. Implement any necessary adapter patterns to ensure backward compatibility. Test the integration thoroughly across different parts of the application to ensure visual consistency and functionality.
