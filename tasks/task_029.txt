# Task ID: 29
# Title: Mobile-Friendly UI Improvements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the UI to be more usable on mobile devices, within the limitations of Google Sheets.
# Details:
Implement mobile-friendly improvements to the application UI:

1. Create responsive CSS styles:
   - Adjust layout for smaller screens
   - Increase touch target sizes for buttons and controls
   - Stack elements vertically on narrow screens
   - Adjust font sizes and spacing for readability

2. Add mobile-specific meta tags:
   - Set viewport configuration for proper scaling
   - Prevent zooming on form inputs
   - Optimize for touch interactions

3. Simplify UI components for mobile:
   - Use full-width buttons
   - Simplify form layouts
   - Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements
   - Improve form element sizing for touch input

4. Apply these improvements across all HTML templates

While Google Sheets itself has limitations on mobile, the custom UI elements should be as mobile-friendly as possible.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test UI appearance on various screen sizes
2. Verify touch targets are appropriately sized
3. Test form inputs on mobile devices
4. Verify stacking behavior works correctly on narrow screens
5. Test readability of text and elements
6. Verify all interactive elements are usable on touch devices
